# Each picoflexx depth solution is generated by fusing a number of individual
# samples together. The number of samples Depends on the use case (mode) that
# the camera is in. At 5Hz this is around 9 samples. Each sample contains three
# floating point images equal to the size of the CCD -- one for distance, one
# for amplitude and one for intensity.

# The raw image is a TYPE_32FC4 image, which means that it has four 32 bit channels.
# C1 : distance (float32)
# C2 : intensity (float32)
# C3 : amplitude (float32)
# C4 : flags (unsigned int32)
